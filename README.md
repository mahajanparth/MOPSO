# A Particle Swarm Optimization-Based Cooperation Method for Multiple-Target Search by Swarm UAVs in Unknown Environments

## Overview
This repository contains a swarm UAV coordination system designed for multi-target search, optimized payload drops, and inter-UAV collision avoidance. The system is based on a **Multi-Target Particle Swarm Optimization (MTPSO)** approach, inspired by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), to enable decentralized cooperative UAV control.

The swarm UAVs utilize onboard sensors and real-time data sharing to dynamically adjust flight paths, detect targets, and deploy payloads efficiently in unknown environments.

## Key Features
- **Decentralized Swarm Coordination**: UAVs operate in a networked environment, sharing limited data to improve efficiency.
- **Multi-Target Search Optimization**: Implements an adaptive PSO variant (MTPSO) for improved search performance.
- **Inter-UAV Collision Avoidance**: Ensures safe flight paths using dynamic trajectory adjustments.
- **Optimized Payload Delivery**: UAVs determine the best drop points in real-time.
- **Simulation Integration**: Uses Ardupilotâ€™s Simulation in the Loop (SITL) for realistic testing.
- **Human Detection**: Vision-based processing using Deep Learning models for identifying targets.
- **Ground Control Station (GCS) Interface**: A control interface to manage UAVs and monitor their status.

## Algorithmic Approach
### **Multi-Target Particle Swarm Optimization (MTPSO)**
The UAV swarm utilizes a modified PSO-based control mechanism:
- Each UAV adjusts its position based on **personal best**, **global best**, and **inter-UAV collision avoidance** factors.
- UAVs dynamically share target data to optimize the search process.
- Payload drops are assigned based on proximity and availability.
- The system integrates various **inertial functions** to balance exploration and exploitation.

### Collision Avoidance
- Ensures UAVs maintain safe distances using consensus-based adjustments.
- The `Dsafe` parameter prevents UAV clustering and reduces congestion.

### Simulation and Testing
- The system is tested using **Ardupilot SITL**.
- Multiple **hyperparameters** such as FOV, velocity, and swarm size are optimized to achieve efficient results.
